They attracted a considerable interest of physicists who study\\nthem to better understand the black holes in general relativity. We consider\\nthe case of stationary axisymmetric metrics and we show that the Kerr black\\nhole is not stable under perturbations in the class of all axisymmetric\\nmetrics. We describe families of axisymmetric metrics having black holes that\\nare the perturbations of the Kerr black hole.
